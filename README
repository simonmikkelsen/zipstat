This software has freely been made avalible under the terms of Gnu General
Public License (GPL).

This readme file is very short. Later real documentation will be made.
Right now I focus on getting some features implemented.

Future features (non particular order):
* Easy installation.
* All code translated to english.
* Easy to translate.
* Use of templates.
* Multiple stats for one user account.

/Installation/
\___________/
1. Put the files in your web directory.
2. Create the database - sorry. Currently there is no SQL-files for that, so
   you are actually a bit lorst here.
3. Edit the file Stier.php (danish for paths).
   * Search for 'timeAdjustSec': Use this value to adjust the time ZIP Stat
     uses relative to the servers time. It is in seconds, so use e.g.
     3*3600 for plus 3 hours or -2*3600 for minutes 2 hours.
   * Search for 'DB_database': Set the value of this, DB_username, DB_hostname,
     and DB_password.
   * Look at 'decimal_comma' a bit below the above. In Denmark we use , as
     decimal comma. If you use . set it to that.
   * Scroll down to the //|URL's|// section. Make sure all the urls are set
     to your need.
   * Just below the URL's section you'll find 'urlMain': Set it to your need.
   * Search for 'base': Set it to the root of the ZIP Stat install on your
     server (not the web).
   * Search for 'zipstat_base': If it is not set to something with dirname(__FILE__)
     set it to your need.
   * Save the file and make sure it is in proper PHP syntax.
   * If you can't get it to work or dosn't understand the danish (sorry again)
     then mail me at zipstat@zip.dk (ask for Simon).
   * Upload the file, create a user, put the code on your website and you are
     flying.
